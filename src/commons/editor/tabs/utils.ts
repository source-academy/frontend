/**
 * Returns the shortest file paths that is uniquely identifiable among
 * all open editor tabs. This is similar to how most code editors available
 * handle the displaying of file names.
 *
 * For example, if there are 3 open editor tabs where the file names are
 * exactly the same, we would need to display more of the file path to be
 * able to distinguish which editor tab corresponds to which file. Given
 * the following absolute file paths:
 * - /a.js
 * - /dir1/a.js
 * - /dir1/dir2/a.js
 * The shortest unique file paths will be:
 * - /a.js
 * - /dir1/a.js
 * - /dir2/a.js
 *
 * @param originalFilePaths The file paths to be shortened.
